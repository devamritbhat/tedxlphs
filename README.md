### Podar Principal's Conclave
The Podar World Schools, which operate with a prime purpose of building young minds to spearhead a dynamic future globally held their Podar Principals’ Conclave in Mumbai on 5th of June, 2024. Around 100 delegates, including Principals, Head Mistresses, Coordinators, Counsellors and Teachers were welcomed from Podar World Schools and Podar Jumbo Kids’ centres across India.

The Trustee, Mr. Raghav Podar mentioned, _“One of the speakers, Devamrit, spoke about 5,000 lines of code, then 15,000 lines of code, and all of that.  I believe this serves as an inspiration for all of you in your schools to have these shining stars as well. You have your own 'Devamrits' in your schools too, and I am waiting to see your schools have these flagship events too.”_
